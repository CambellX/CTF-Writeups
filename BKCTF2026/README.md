# README
Pretty chill CTF. This is the first CTF we've played as a club, so it was pretty fun collaborating with everyone.
My role was to complete the web challenges and random misc. These writeups will be strictly web though. 

We got first in the University of Washington division which was pretty nice.

The web was pretty unique and fun. The last web had the simplest solution but was insanely guessy (I hate sourceless clientside)
